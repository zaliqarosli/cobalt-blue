          </p>
          <p>
            The story of cobalt blue as a pigment began in the early 19th
            century, though cobalt compounds had long been employed in ceramics
            and glassmaking to create vivid blue glazes. It was in 1802 that
            French chemist Louis Jacques Thénard discovered cobalt blue as a
            viable pigment for painting, seeking a lasting alternative to
            earlier, less stable options like ultramarine or azurite. These
            predecessors were often prone to discoloration or far too costly for
            widespread use. Cobalt blue quickly gained popularity among
            prominent artists, including <em>Vincent van Gogh</em> and
            <em>Claude Monet</em>, drawn to its bright, clear tone and
            exceptional covering power.
          </p>
          <p>
            In addition to its use in fine art, cobalt blue has been widely
            applied in ceramics, glassware, and even architecture. It’s commonly
            seen in traditional Chinese blue-and-white porcelain, where cobalt
            oxide is used to produce intricate blue designs on white
            backgrounds. The pigment has also been used in the creation of
            stained glass windows and enamel work, thanks to its vibrant color
            and stability at high temperatures.
          </p>

            <em>erythrite</em> (Co₃(AsO₄)₂·8H₂O), known as "cobalt bloom,"
            boasts a vivid bright pink or purple color. This striking appearance
            often aids geologists in identifying cobalt deposits in the field.
            <em>Skutterudite</em> (CoAs₃) is yet another cobalt-rich mineral,
            distinguished by its metallic silver-white sheen, but it too
            contains arsenic, presenting additional challenges during
            extraction.
          </p>
          <p>
            The journey from mineral to metal involves a complex refining
            process that includes roasting and leaching the ores, followed by
            purification methods to isolate cobalt. This metal plays a crucial
            role in contemporary industries, particularly in the production of
            rechargeable batteries and high-performance alloys. Furthermore,
